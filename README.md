# DIY_PIANO_USING_ARDUINO
We made a Piano using no. of PUSH BUTTONS, each push button makes a different sound.  The sound is produced by the buzzer due to respective PUSH BUTTON.  We change the sounds of the buzzer by changing the frequency using TONE( ) function. For each push button, an led will be connected for showing which push button making the sound.
