# DIY_PIANO_USING_ARDUINO

We made a Piano using no. of PUSH BUTTONS, each push button makes a different sound.  The sound is produced by the buzzer due to respective PUSH BUTTON.  We change the sounds of the buzzer by changing the frequency using TONE() function. For each push button, an led will be connected for showing which push button making the sound.
Using tone() fn we can produce musical tunes like saregamapa, any background music and many more.
The arduino code is written very cleary with proper comments.
We can add timer circuits, to schedule the playing of sounds.
